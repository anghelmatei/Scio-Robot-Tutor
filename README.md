## Scio

Python software for Raspberry Pi integrating GPT-4, Tavily, and Picovoice for voice activation, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and image processing and closest face detection and tracking with OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers. Implemented robust error handling, multithreading and context-aware responses to ensure seamless user interaction and real-time feedback.

## Features

- Voice activation using Porcupine
- Natural language conversation using OpenAI
- Respond in a changeable personality style
- Web search functionality using Tavily
- Voice response using Pygame
- Is just fun to use (lots of people asked to try it, both at the hackathon and PoliFest)
## Demo (used to be a voice assistant inspired by the robot GLaDOS from the Portal games universe)
